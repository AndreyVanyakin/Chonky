# Introduction

**Chonky is a file browser component for React.** It tries to recreate the native file
browsing experience in your browser. Chonky supports drag & drop, file selection,
image thumbnails, and much more!

# Quick demo

Check out the demo below to see what Chonky can do. Things to try:

-   Try opening files and entering folders.
-   Try keyboard navigation - use `Tab`, `Space` and `Enter` keys.
-   Try selecting files by click on them or pressing `Ctrl+A`.

# Philosophy

Please read this section to understand what Chonky is and is not.

<br />

### 1. Chonky is the presentation layer.

Chonky takes a list of files and shows them to the user. It does not and should not
know where the files came from, nor should it now how file operations are carried out.

<br />

### 2. Chonky is filesystem-agnostic.

Chonky tries to stay **unopinionated** when it comes to interactions with the file
system (FS).

<br />

### 3. Developing file browsers is hard. Each use case is unique.

At the same time, Chonky tries to cover all possible interactions with the user. This includes support for keyboard
navigation and common keyboard shortcuts, support for file selections, drag & drop, different file views, and much more.
