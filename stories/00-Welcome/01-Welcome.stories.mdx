# Introduction

Chonky is a file browser component for React. It tries to recreate the native file browsing experience in your
browser. This means your users can make selections, drag & drop files, toggle file view between "large thumbnails"
and "detailed list", use keyboard shortcuts, and much more!

### Chonky features:

-   It's file system agnostic - data can come from an arbitrary source as long as it follows the required format.
-   Supports async file system logic - via thumb lazy-loading and loading placeholders.
-   Users can choose between 3 views: Details, medium thumbnails, large thumbnails. All file views are responsive and
    mobile-friendly.
-   Developers can pass file action handlers to define custom behaviour for file opening, moving or deleting.
-   Supports file selections and _drag & drop (WIP)_, sorting and _text search (WIP)_.
-   Supports [windowing](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#virtualize-long-lists) (a.k.a.
    virtualization) for long file lists ([see example](#section-virtualization-with-10000-files)).
-   Supports common keyboard shortcuts.
-   Supports file thumbnails (e.g. generated from videos or images).
-   Detects common file types, showing appropriate icons.
