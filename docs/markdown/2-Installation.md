First, add Chonky to your npm project:

```bash
npm install --save chonky
```

You should now be able to use Chonky components by importing them from the `chonky` package. You will also need to 
import the CSS file to style the component. In the end, your imports would look similar to this:

```js
import 'chonky/style/main.css';
import {FileBrowser, FolderView} from 'chonky';
```

Below, you can see a very basic usage example. Take a look at its source code by pressing "View Code" below the example.

```js { "componentPath": "../components/Installation.js" }
```
