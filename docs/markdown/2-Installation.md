First, add Chonky your project:

```bash
npm install --save chonky
```

You can then use Chonky components by importing them from the `chonky` package. You will also need to import the CSS 
file to style the component. Take a look at this example of a file browser (try double-clicking on `README.md`):

```js { "componentPath": "../components/Installation.js" }
```
